Release Notes - SAME70 Software Package
------------------------------------------
Release version: 1.5
Release date: 2015-11

1 Overview
----------
The SAME70 Software Package consists of SAME70 micro-controller
drivers, software services & libraries, and demonstration applications.

Each software module is provided with full source code, example of usage, rich
html documentation and ready-to-use projects for the GNU GCC, IAR EWARM and
MDK ARM μVision compilers.


2 Downloading and Installing
----------------------------

2.1 ATMEL STUDIO SOFTWARE PACKAGE
---------------------
This installer contains SAME70 softpack 1.5 software package support for Atmel Studio 6.2/7.0.
All examples contains studio project file (_6_2.cproj) and open directly in ATMEL studio 6.2 IDE interface.
All examples contains studio project file (_7_0.cproj) and open directly in ATMEL studio 7.0 IDE interface.

It support JLINK and Atmel Embedded Debugger (EDBG) probe for on-board debugging. The EDBG is a composite USB device of three interfaces.
Note: If user use EDBG to debug, please unplug JLINK and power off/on the target board.

2.2 GNU ARM embedded SOFTWARE PACKAGE
---------------------
Software package for GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors(later than V 4.9.3).
The official linker of GNU tools is https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download.

Each example is delivered with a single Makefile. Compilation is launched
using the following command:
make

Some extra parameters can be specified. CROSS_COMPILE parameter can be used
to specify another tool-chain:
make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi-

All default parameters defined in Makefile can be overridden through the
command line:
make TRACE_LEVEL=4

The default target will compile the example for all available memory
configurations (sram, flash). According to the memory configuration,
the corresponding .lds file (located in libraries/libboard/resources_e70/gcc) is used
during the link. The compilation can be limited to a single memory
configuration specifying the memory as a target:
make MEMORIES=sram

GDB can be launched using command line. Several gdb commands shall be used
to connect to the gdbserver, to initialize memories then load the application.
These commands can be stored in a .gdb file. Some default .gdb files located in
resources/gcc directory provide useful standard settings for AT91SAM Evaluation Kits.
In order to simplify command line debugging using gdb, a makefile target sequentially
starts the compilation then launch the debug session and load the application:
make debug_sram

Several additional requirements are mandatory before building this target:
SAM-ICE gdbserver shall be started before.
gdb tries to connect to gdbserver through the localhost:2331 port.
This is the default with SAM-ICE gdbserver.


2.3 IAR SOFTWARE PACKAGE
---------------------
SAME70 Software Package for EWARM requires an installation of IAR Systems Embedded Workbench
for ARM version later than 7.30.x

The SAME70 Software Package for EWARM will change the following components of your existing
IAR EWARM 7.30.x installation:
- Example projects for SAME70-xPlained board
- C-SPY device description files
- Device selection files
- Flash loader for SAME70 device
- Linker scripts

After installation, the examples will be accessible under the "Example Projects" item in the
IAR Information Center for ARM (show at EWARM startup or with "Help -> Information Center").
Choose "Atmel" from the manufacturer list, then choose SAME70-xPlained board.
The list of supported examples will be displayed so you can easily clone the ones you are
interested in.

In addition, the examples come with HTML documentation explaining what they do and how to
use them. It will be located in the "arm/examples/Atmel/SAME70_Xplained/documentation"
subdirectory of your EWARM installation folder.

The EWARM C-SPY debugger offers a particularly useful feature: in the Registers Window, the
user can see the contents of peripheral registers in the chip. This functionality requires Device
Description Files which provide the register mapping information for each board.
Installing the SAME70 Software Package for EWARM will add the .ddf files for SAME70 Atmel
micro-controllers.
The device description file is included in the SAME70 Software Package for EWARM.


2.4 KEIL MDK μVision SOFTWARE PACKAGE
---------------------
SAME70 Software Package for μVision requires an installation of μVision for ARM MDK version later than 5.12.
Please install SAM-E_DFP 1.0.0 package to support SAME devices in IDE.
Examples can be compiled and debugged using μVision IDE.


2.4 SEGGER SAM-ICE driver
---------------------
Install JLinkARM driver version later than V4.94 or later to get support for SAME70 chip with SAM-ICE probe.
The official link for SEGGER is https://www.segger.com/jlink-software.html

Note: Recommend to install JLINK driver version later than V4.97c to get fix in debugger step mode.
